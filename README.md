# Problem_Solving
### if you reach here, I'm proud of you from 28/7/2024

## Description 
- This repo created to improve problem solving skills/ CS mindset based on python3 
- Goal:  Solve most common 500 problems -> high value!
## Notes
- Learn by Doing
- Don't repeat and try to think first, put the solutions and understand them -> Learn how to code and how to think from expert programmer minds (Effictive method!)
- Write ideas here because you neeed repitation
- Easy -> Medium -> Hard (study level by level)

## Leetcode roadmap
### Round 1
`Top 100 Liked Questions`
`Top 150 Interview Questions`
- Now you reach half of journy
- Don't forget Easy -> Medium -> Hard (study level by level)
### Round 2
- Random 125 easy
- Random 75 medium
- Random 50 hard

## Ideas

- Top 100 Liked Questions

1) Two sum (brute force solution)
 - Question idea: Return indicies of 2 numbers from an array when add them up it equal target(integer) value
 - Solution idea:
 - Class -> contains the solution
 - function -> contains the solution process
 - function parameters ->
 - -> `self` -> class instance(object) parameter -> everything it points to is related to the class dirctly not local(not - 
 linked) method/attribute, use case (instance, Calling  Methods, Modifying Instance Variables)
 - -> `nums: List[int]` ->  parameter representing a list of integers.
 - -> `target: int` -> parameter representing an integer value.
 - -> `List[int]` -> parameter specifies the return type of the method, which is parameter 1 of type list of integers
